I'm a Graphic Programmer, with a Computer Analyst degree (and currently one year away from my Computer Engineering degree), but I've been coding since I was 15 as I wanted to enter a videogame contest at the time.
This blog is a place to dump my ideas and stuff I find while working, to remember them later and maybe help someone out in the process :D.
